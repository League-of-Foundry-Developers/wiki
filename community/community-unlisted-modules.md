* [https://github.com/Jonwh25/summoner](https://github.com/Jonwh25/summoner)

This FoundryVTT Module adds a simple compendium pack to help with DnD5e spells that summon creatures. It is nothing fancy. My players were casting find familiar and I tried to use the npc creatures that are in the DnD5e system and it wasn't working. So all I did was create actor/player types for each creature they could summon.

Hope this saves you some time.

Right now this only supports the following spells:

*Find Familiar
*Unseen Servant

# Appendix
## Appendix A: Best Editing Practices

- Ideally, the term module should be used over mod, unless it is in the mod’s name or the author’s description. Mod can carry connotations from other games that might not exist in Foundry VTT, while modules in Foundry VTT can range from NPC compendiums, to worlds, to “enhancement suite” functions. They’re effectively the same thing, but it helps to emphasize how flexible Foundry Virtual Tabletop is. 
- Links to modules should link to the author’s page for it, if such exists. This helps emphasize the module author’s control over their creation, and allows users to see information that the module author deems important. If you have the module author’s permission otherwise, or you are the creator, feel free to link directly to the module download link. 
- Modules are sorted by system compatibility, then function, and then alphabetically. If a module is compatible with more than one system, but not “universally” in Foundry Virtual Tabletop, note compatibility in each system’s section. Otherwise, if a module is compatible universally, list it in the appropriate section for “universal modules”. 
- Ensure that Foundry is noted as “Foundry VTT” or “Foundry Virtual Tabletop” in writing, unless it is the module title, or the module author desires otherwise in the description. This helps emphasize Foundry’s role as a unique, standalone tabletop, and helps distinguish it from other brands using the word “foundry”.   
- Ideally, each module should be separated by a single line break. This is just to help it look neat. 
- Modules should not be listed if they violate existing copyright law.
