In a self-hosted setting, the application runs on your own computer and creates a local web server which allows other players to connect directly to your computer. The self-hosted mode is most similar to the setup of Fantasy Grounds, Maptool, or GM Forge.

# Advantages
- Free (assuming you have a computer).
- Almost zero setup.
- Easy management of content using your own computer’s file system.

# Disadvantages
- Your world is only available when the host is running a session.
- Requires clients to be able to connect to your computer - either through a local network or using port forwarding.
- Player experience depends on the host’s internet speed.
